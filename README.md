erebral Command Automation is a cutting-edge project that enables control of physical systems using real-time brainwave signals. Designed as a brain-computer interface (BCI) system, it allows users to operate an RC car using nothing but their mental focus and relaxation states, detected through EEG (electroencephalogram) signals.
